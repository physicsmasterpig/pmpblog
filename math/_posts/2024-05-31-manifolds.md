# Manifolds and Smooth Structure

{:toc}
## Introduction
A manifold is a mathematical space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More formally, a topological manifold is a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. Manifolds are used in various branches of mathematics and physics, including geometry, topology, and general relativity. This document will provide an in-depth exploration of manifolds, focusing on detailed definitions, examples, and properties.

## Definitions
### Topological Manifolds
A **topological manifold** of dimension $$n$$ is a topological space $$M$$ such that:
- $$M$$ is Hausdorff.
- $$M$$ is second-countable.
- Every point in $$M$$ has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$.

**Hausdorff Space:** A topological space $$X$$ is called **Hausdorff** if for any two distinct points $$x, y \in X$$, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods $$U$$ of $$x$$ and $$V$$ of $$y$$ such that $$U \cap V = \emptyset$$.

**Second-Countable:** A topological space $$X$$ is **second-countable** if it has a countable base for its topology. This means there exists a countable collection of open sets $$\left\lbrace U_i\right\rbrace$$ such that any open set in $$X$$ can be written as a union of some of these sets.

**Local Homeomorphism:** A **local homeomorphism** is a map $$f: X \to Y$$ between topological spaces such that every point in $$X$$ has an open neighborhood $$U$$ for which $$f(U)$$ is open in $$Y$$ and $$f_U: U \to f(U)$$ is a homeomorphism.

### Differentiable Manifolds
A **differentiable manifold** is a topological manifold equipped with an additional structure that allows for differential calculus. Specifically, it is a manifold with a differentiable atlas.

**Charts and Atlases:** A **chart** for a topological manifold $$M$$ is a pair $$(U, \varphi)$$ where $$U \subset M$$ is open and $$\varphi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a homeomorphism. An **atlas** is a collection of charts that covers $$M$$.

**Transition Maps:** Given two charts $$(U, \varphi)$$ and $$(V, \psi)$$ such that $$U \cap V \neq \emptyset$$, the **transition map** is $$\psi \circ \varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)$$. For a differentiable manifold, these transition maps must be differentiable.

**Smooth Manifolds:** A **smooth manifold** is a differentiable manifold for which all transition maps are infinitely differentiable (smooth).

## Examples of Manifolds
1. **The Euclidean Space $$\mathbb{R}^n$$**: The simplest example of a manifold is the Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. It is trivially a manifold because it is already homeomorphic to itself. In this case, the entire space $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ is covered by a single chart.
2. **The Circle $$S^1$$**: The circle $$S^1$$ can be defined as the set of points in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ at a distance 1 from the origin:
   \\[
   S^1 = \left\lbrace (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\right\rbrace
   \\]
   We can cover $$S^1$$ with two charts: one mapping the upper semicircle to an interval and one mapping the lower semicircle to an interval.
3. **The $$n$$-Sphere $$S^n$$**: The $$n$$-dimensional sphere $$S^n$$ is the set of points in $$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$$ at a unit distance from the origin:
   \\[
   S^n = \left\lbrace (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n+1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_{n+1}^2 = 1\right\rbrace
   \\]
   For example, $$S^2$$ is the surface of a sphere in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$.
4. **The Torus $$T^2$$**: The torus $$T^2$$ can be represented as the product of two circles: $$T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$$. Points on the torus can be described by pairs of angles $$(\theta_1, \theta_2)$$, each angle ranging from $$0$$ to $$2\pi$$.
5. **Projective Spaces:** The **real projective space** $$\mathbb{RP}^n$$ is the set of lines through the origin in $$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$$. It can be constructed by identifying antipodal points on the $$n$$-sphere $$S^n$$.
6. **Lie Groups:** A **Lie group** is a group that is also a smooth manifold, where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth maps. Examples include the circle group $$S^1$$ and the general linear group $$GL(n, \mathbb{R})$$.
7. **Hyperbolic Space:** The **hyperbolic space** $$\mathbb{H}^n$$ is a space with constant negative curvature. It can be modeled by the upper half-space in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ with a specific metric.
8. **Complex Manifolds:** A **complex manifold** is a manifold modeled on $$\mathbb{C}^n$$ instead of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. Charts and transition maps are holomorphic, meaning they are complex differentiable.

## Properties of Manifolds
### Orientability
A manifold is **orientable** if it has a consistent choice of orientation on each of its tangent spaces. For example, the MÃ¶bius strip is non-orientable.

For a manifold to be orientable, it must be possible to choose an atlas such that all transition maps have positive Jacobian determinants. This ensures a consistent orientation across the manifold.

### Compactness
A manifold is **compact** if it is a compact space in the topological sense, i.e., it is closed and bounded. Examples include the sphere $$S^n$$ and the torus $$T^2$$.

For manifolds, compactness can often be checked using the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that a subset of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

### Connectedness
A manifold is **connected** if it is a connected topological space, meaning there is a path between any two points. The sphere $$S^n$$ is connected, whereas two disjoint circles are not.

### Tangent Spaces and Vector Fields
At each point $$p$$ on a differentiable manifold $$M$$, the **tangent space** $$T_pM$$ is a vector space that intuitively contains the possible directions in which one can tangentially pass through $$p$$. Formally, it is the vector space spanned by the derivatives of smooth curves passing through $$p$$.

A **vector field** on a manifold $$M$$ assigns a tangent vector to each point of $$M$$. For example, in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, the vector field $$\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (-y, x)$$ defines a rotation around the origin.

An **integral curve** of a vector field $$\mathbf{F}$$ is a curve $$\gamma(t)$$ such that $$\gamma'(t) = \mathbf{F}(\gamma(t))$$. These curves represent the trajectories of particles moving under the influence of the vector field.

### Differential Forms
A **differential form** on a manifold is a completely antisymmetric tensor that can be integrated over the manifold. Differential forms generalize the concept of functions and vector fields.

The **exterior derivative** is an operator $$d$$ that takes a $$k$$-form to a $$(k+1)$$-form, generalizing the concept of the differential of a function. For a 1-form $$\omega = f dx + g dy$$, its exterior derivative is $$d\omega = df \wedge dx + dg \wedge dy$$.

One of the most important results involving differential forms is **Stokes' theorem**, which generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus. It states that for a compact oriented manifold $$M$$ with boundary $$\partial M$$, and a differential form $$\omega$$ of degree $$\dim(M)-1$$:
\\[
\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega
\\]

## Charts and Atlases in Detail
### Charts
A **chart** on a manifold $$M$$ is a pair $$(U, \varphi)$$, where $$U$$ is an open subset of $$M$$ and $$\varphi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. Charts allow us to use the tools of calculus by providing a local coordinate system on $$M$$.

**Example: Charts on $$S^2$$**: Consider the sphere $$S^2$$. We can use stereographic projection from the north pole to define a chart. Let $$N = (0,0,1)$$. The stereographic projection $$\varphi: S^2 \setminus \left\lbrace N\right\rbrace \to \mathbb{R}^2$$ is given by:
\\[
\varphi(x, y, z) = \left(\frac{x}{1-z}, \frac{y}{1-z}\right)
\\]
This maps points on the sphere, except the north pole, to $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

### Atlases
An **atlas** on a manifold $$M$$ is a collection of charts $$\left\lbrace (U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)\right\rbrace$$ such that $$\bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha = M$$. Atlases allow us to cover the entire manifold with charts, ensuring that every point has a neighborhood that looks like $$\mathbb{R}^n$$.

Two atlases $$\left\lbrace (U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)\right\rbrace$$ and $$\left\lbrace (V_\beta, \psi_\beta)\right\rbrace$$ on a manifold $$M$$ are said to be **compatible** if their union is also an atlas. This means that the transition maps $$\psi_\beta \circ \varphi_\alpha^{-1}$$ are smooth where defined.

A **maximal atlas** is an atlas that contains all charts that are compatible with it. Every differentiable manifold has a unique maximal atlas, which includes all possible charts that can be used.

## Smooth Manifolds
### Smooth Structures
A **smooth structure** on a manifold $$M$$ is an atlas such that all transition maps are smooth. This allows us to perform calculus on $$M$$. Smooth manifolds are the primary objects of study in differential geometry.

**Example: Smooth Structure on $$\mathbb{R}^n$$**: The Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ with the standard coordinates $$(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$$ has a natural smooth structure. The transition maps between overlapping charts are the identity map, which is smooth.

### Differentiable Maps
A map $$f: M \to N$$ between two smooth manifolds $$M$$ and $$N$$ is **differentiable** if, for any charts $$(U, \varphi)$$ on $$M$$ and $$(V, \psi)$$ on $$N$$, the map $$\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}$$ is differentiable.

**Example: Differentiable Map between Spheres:** Consider the map $$f: S^2 \to S^2$$ given by $$f(x, y, z) = (-x, -y, -z)$$. This map is differentiable because it is a composition of differentiable functions in the stereographic charts of $$S^2$$.

### Tangent Spaces and Smooth Manifolds
At each point $$p$$ on a smooth manifold $$M$$, the tangent space $$T_pM$$ can be defined using the derivatives of smooth curves passing through $$p$$. This provides a way to generalize the concept of tangent vectors to smooth manifolds.

In a chart $$(U, \varphi)$$, the tangent space $$T_pM$$ can be represented by the partial derivatives $$\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$$, which form a basis for $$T_pM$$.

## Additional Examples of Manifolds
1. **Hyperbolic Space:** The **hyperbolic space** $$\mathbb{H}^n$$ is a space with constant negative curvature. It can be modeled by the upper half-space in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ with a specific metric.

   **PoincarÃ© Half-Plane Model:** In the PoincarÃ© half-plane model, the hyperbolic space $$\mathbb{H}^2$$ is represented as $$\left\lbrace (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid y > 0\right\rbrace$$ with the metric
   \\[
   ds^2 = \frac{dx^2 + dy^2}{y^2}
   \\]
   This metric induces a geometry with constant negative curvature.

2. **Complex Manifolds:** A **complex manifold** is a manifold modeled on $$\mathbb{C}^n$$ instead of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. Charts and transition maps are holomorphic, meaning they are complex differentiable.

   **Example: Complex Projective Space $$\mathbb{CP}^n$$:** The complex projective space $$\mathbb{CP}^n$$ is the set of lines through the origin in $$\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$$. It is a complex manifold of complex dimension $$n$$.

## Advanced Properties of Manifolds
### Homology and Cohomology
Homology and cohomology theories provide algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homotopy equivalence. These invariants are useful for distinguishing between different types of manifolds.

### Curvature
Curvature is a measure of how much a manifold deviates from being flat. The **Riemann curvature tensor** is a key object in understanding the intrinsic curvature of a manifold.

The **sectional curvature** of a 2-dimensional plane in the tangent space of a manifold measures the curvature of geodesics lying in that plane.

The **Ricci curvature** is obtained by tracing the Riemann curvature tensor and gives a measure of the volume distortion in geodesic balls.

The **scalar curvature** is the trace of the Ricci curvature and provides a single value summarizing the curvature at a point.
